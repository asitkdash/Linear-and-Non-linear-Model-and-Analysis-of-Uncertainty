Use cross validation to find the optimal order of polynomial

Problem description
----------------------------
A chemical engineer measured various properties of a gas and created a training data set. The measured properties include temperature, pressure, thermal conductivity, and sound velocity.
The schema of the data set is shown below:
Dataset(Tm, Pr, Th, Sv, Idx) where all of the attributes are type double. This data set will be available on the course page.
The chemical engineer wonders if there are any functional relationships between the measured physical properties (Tm, Pr, Th, Sv) and a chemical index, Idx.
